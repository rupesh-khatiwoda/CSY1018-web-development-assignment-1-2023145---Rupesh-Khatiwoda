                <h3>My View on Coding</h3> <!--giving header-->
                <p class="paragraph"><!--Giving class for paragraphs-->
               I was well known about coding , programming from few years back . It was when I was learning C-programming in my high school
               .Then I got quite a intrest in coding and after joining my bachlors degree I started learning with HTML as a base . I knew some 
               basics of it but i was not aware of that coding is like so vast that I havenot even touched the side of it . I have been learning 
               HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) for a while and I kind of interact with it . After that I was taught about CSS that you can actually decorate your HTML page
                very easily with its help . After watching codes of other people in social media platforms , chrome sites and Youtube . I am confident 
                that I remember most of the codes and how its done. After some time I was introduced with Git and Github page .Git hub was a site where u can put pull push your texts code images files 
                with help for terminal such as powershell , comand prompt , git bash etc. It was confusing at first but it became easy . Though I am still
                learning HTML to its fullest . I am also learning Php from online because it is quite similar to HTML .As I am a begginer I am just looking at others 
                how they practice and use HTML ,CSS,Php and Java script as well.After that I also started basics of java script though I dont know how to use 
                it properly .

              <h3>Introduction of the Site</h3><!--giving header-->
              <p class="paragraph">
              The purpose of this site report is to evaluate the performance and usability of a portfolio website.
               My portfolio website is designed to showcase the works that I can do and perform.
                My website is designed to br flexible with users and have an engaging interface, 
                which will allow the users to explore the portfolio in a friendly manner. My portfolio
                 website is flexible in performence , responsive and user friendly environment.Most of the images of the site is from unsplash 
                 and few images are mine .Site has hamburger which I was able to do without using java script.
                 The checkbox was used and hamburger icon was used on top of it and checkbox is hidden.So when screen is shrunk the hamburger appears 
                 due to media code which I setup for screen sizes. when hamburger is touched the nav bar inside the check box appears.From ther you can 
                 go to any site u wish in my portfolio website.

                <h3> COLORS AND COMBINATION</h3> <!--giving header-->
                <p class="paragraph"><!--Giving class for paragraphs-->
                    Most of the colors that I choose were from google. So I used paint and visual code studio to gets code such as (#00000)which also represents 
                    black color . I use gray blue color because it was not sensetive to my eyes and I use little light color on the body that the user can 
                    diffrentiate navigation bar and menu content. For letters I use white color because it was very easy for me to look white so the gray blue which was 
                    dark didnot over shadow my words in my menu list in the navigation bar.

                <p class="paragraph"> Design the most eye catching aspect in a website.For the user a best and flexible design is most suitable for using the website further.
                   By taking it into the consideration I designed my porfolio website to be simple and flexible to use. I also used alot of images for background to make it attractive
                   and diffrent from others .As for why I choose this design is because it was flexible for me to work with and I hope others also feel flexible with my website and connect with it.
