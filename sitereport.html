              which will allow the users to explore the portfolio in a friendly manner. My portfolio

        <h3 class="mid"> COLORS AND COMBINATION</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"><!--Giving class for paragraphs-->
            Most of the colors that I choose were from google. So I used paint and visual code studio to gets code such as (#00000)which also represents 
            black color . I use gray blue color because it was not sensetive to my eyes and I use little light color on the body that the user can 
            diffrentiate navigation bar and menu content. For letters I use white color because it was very easy for me to look white so the gray blue which was 
            dark didnot over shadow my words in my menu list in the navigation bar.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mid">Design</h3>
         <p class="paragraph"> Design the most eye catching aspect in a website.For the user a best and flexible design is most suitable for using the website further.
            By taking it into the consideration I designed my porfolio website to be simple and flexible to use.
