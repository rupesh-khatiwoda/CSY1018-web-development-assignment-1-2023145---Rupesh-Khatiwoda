                <p class="paragraph"><!--Giving class for paragraphs-->
                  Namaste, I've been learning to code for a few years now, starting with C-programming in high school. 
                  I became really interested in coding and decided to dive into HTML as a base when I started my bachelor's degree.  Although 
                  I knew some basics, I had no idea how vast the world of coding truly was. I've been working with HTML for a while now, and I
                   feel pretty comfortable with it. 
                  I learned about CSS and how to decorate my HTML pages, which was really cool. I've been looking at other people's
                   code on social media, Chrome sites, and YouTube, and I'm pretty confident  in my ability to remember most
                    of the codes and how they work.  Recently, I was introduced to Git and Github, which is a
                     site where you can push, pull, and share your code with others. It was confusing at first, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. 
                     Although I'm still learning HTML, I'm also exploring PHP online because it's similar to HTML.
                  As a beginner programmer, I'm mostly looking at how others practice and use HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript.
                   I've started learning the basics of JavaScript, but I don't know how to use it properly yet. I'm pretty average at
                    CSS, but I'm really good at remembering codes when I see them. However, sometimes 
                    I forget how to use the code that I know, which is a bit of a downfall for me.
                  Anyway, I'm hoping to become a really good programmer in the next few years!

              <h3>My experience in Web Development</h3><!--giving header-->
              <p class="paragraph">
                During my experience with the web development module, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and Git. HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, 
                allowed me to structure the content of a web page. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, helped me to style the content and layout of the web page.
                 With Git, I learned how to manage versions of my code and collaborate with others through Github.
                At the beginning of the module, I had a basic understanding of HTML, but I found it difficult to remember all of the different tags and elements. 
                However, with practice, I became more comfortable and confident in using HTML to structure web pages.
                 I found that CSS was much more challenging, as it required me to understand the box model, positioning, and responsive design.
                  However, by the end of the module, I was able to create visually appealing web pages using CSS.
                Git was a new concept to me, but I found it to be very useful for version control and collaboration. 
                It was challenging to understand the Git workflow and commands at first, but I found it to be a valuable tool for managing my code and 
                collaborating with others.
                Overall, the web development module was a great learning experience for me. I gained a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and Git, and 
                I feel more confident in my ability to create and manage web pages. I hope to continue to improve my skills in web development and 
                apply what I have learned to future projects.

                <h3> COLORS,FONTS AND IMAGES</h3> <!--giving header-->
                <p class="paragraph"><!--Giving class for paragraphs-->
                  The dark violet color used in the website design not only adds visual interest, but also conveys a sense of creativity,
                   inspiration,
                   and sophistication. Dark violet is often associated with introspection, calmness, and luxury, making it a great choice
                    for a website that showcases creativity and innovation.
                  To create a striking contrast, I chose to use white font color on the dark violet background.
                   White is a high-contrast color that is 
                  easy to read and is associated with purity, clarity, and simplicity. When combined with the dark violet background,
                   the white font color 
                  creates a sense of balance between the creative and sophisticated qualities of dark violet, and the purity and 
                  simplicity of white.
                  Overall, the use of dark violet and white in the website design not only creates an eye-catching and visually appealing website, 
                  but also conveys a strong brand identity that is both creative and sophisticated, while also being easy to use and navigate.

                <p class="paragraph"><!--giving class paragraph-->
                  The most eye-catching aspect of a website is often its visual design. In order to create an engaging and attractive
                   website for users, it is important to use visually appealing elements.
                   For my personal portfolio website, I chose for a simple and flexible design that is easy to use.
                    I used a lot of images for the background,   which makes it stand out from other websites. One of 
                    the reasons why I chose this design was because it was flexible for me to work with. 
                   By using a simple layout and clear labeling of menu options, I was able to create a website that is easy 
                   to navigate. This not only makes it easier for me to manage, but also ensures that users can easily find the 
                   information they are looking for.In order to create the best user experience, it is important to focus on creating
                    a website that is both visually appealing and easy to use. By taking these factors into consideration, I was able to
                     design a website that I believe is flexible and user-friendly. I hope that others will
                      also find my website to be easy to use and connect with it.
