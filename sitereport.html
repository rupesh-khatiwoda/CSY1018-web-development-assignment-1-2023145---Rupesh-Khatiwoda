                <p class="paragraph"><!--Giving class for paragraphs-->
                  Hey there! I've been learning to code for a few years now, starting with C-programming in high school. 
                  I became really interested in coding and decided to dive into HTML as a base when I started my bachelor's degree.
                   Although I knew some basics, I had no idea how vast the world of coding truly was.
                  I've been working with HTML for a while now, and I feel pretty comfortable with it. 
                  I learned about CSS and how to decorate my HTML pages, which was really cool.
                   I've been looking at other people's code on social media, Chrome sites, and YouTube, and I'm pretty confident  in my
                    ability to remember most of the codes and how they work.  Recently, I was introduced to Git and Github, which is a 
                    site where you can push, pull, and share your code with others. It was confusing at first, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. Although I'm still learning HTML, I'm also exploring PHP online because it's similar to HTML.
                  As a beginner programmer, I'm mostly looking at how others practice and use HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript.
                   I've started learning the basics of JavaScript, but I don't know how to use it properly yet. I'm pretty average at
                    CSS, but I'm really good at remembering codes when I see them. However, sometimes 
                    I forget how to use the code that I know, which is a bit of a downfall for me.
                  Anyway, I'm hoping to become a really good programmer in the next few years!

              <h3>My experience in Web Development</h3><!--giving header-->
              <p class="paragraph">
                During my experience with the web development module, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and Git. HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, 
                allowed me to structure the content of a web page. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, helped me to style the content and layout of the web page.
                 With Git, I learned how to manage versions of my code and collaborate with others through Github.
                At the beginning of the module, I had a basic understanding of HTML, but I found it difficult to remember all of the different tags and elements. 
                However, with practice, I became more comfortable and confident in using HTML to structure web pages.
                 I found that CSS was much more challenging, as it required me to understand the box model, positioning, and responsive design.
                  However, by the end of the module, I was able to create visually appealing web pages using CSS.
                Git was a new concept to me, but I found it to be very useful for version control and collaboration. 
                It was challenging to understand the Git workflow and commands at first, but I found it to be a valuable tool for managing my code and collaborating with others.
                Overall, the web development module was a great learning experience for me. I gained a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and Git, and 
                I feel more confident in my ability to create and manage web pages. I hope to continue to improve my skills in web development and 
                apply what I have learned to future projects.

                <h3> COLORS AND COMBINATION</h3> <!--giving header-->
                <p class="paragraph"><!--Giving class for paragraphs-->
                    Most of the colors that I choose were from google. So I used paint and visual code studio to gets code such as (#00000)which also represents 
                    black color . I use gray blue color because it was not sensetive to my eyes and I use little light color on the body that the user can 
                    diffrentiate navigation bar and menu content. For letters I use white color because it was very easy for me to look white so the gray blue which was 
                    dark didnot over shadow my words in my menu list in the navigation bar.

                <p class="paragraph"> Design the most eye catching aspect in a website.For the user a best and flexible design is most suitable for using the website further.
                   By taking it into the consideration I designed my porfolio website to be simple and flexible to use. I also used alot of images for background to make it attractive
                   and diffrent from others .As for why I choose this design is because it was flexible for me to work with and I hope others also feel flexible with my website and connect with it.
