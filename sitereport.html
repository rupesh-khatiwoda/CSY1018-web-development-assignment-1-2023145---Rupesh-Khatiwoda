                <p class="paragraph"><!--Giving class for paragraphs-->
                    Most of the colors that I choose were from google. So I used paint and visual code studio to gets code such as (#00000)which also represents 
                    black color . I use gray blue color because it was not sensetive to my eyes and I use little light color on the body that the user can 
                    diffrentiate navigation bar and menu content. For letters I use white color because it was very easy for me to look white so the gray blue which was 
                    dark didnot over shadow my words in my menu list in the navigation bar.

                   By taking it into the consideration I designed my porfolio website to be simple and flexible to use. I also used alot of images for background to make it attractive
